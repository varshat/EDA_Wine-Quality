# Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves examining and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics, uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and formulate initial hypotheses. Here are some key steps and techniques typically used in exploratory data analysis:

#Data Collection: Gather the relevant dataset you want to analyze. Ensure the dataset is well-structured and contains the necessary variables for analysis.

#Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data. This step ensures data quality and reliability.

#Summary Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartiles, and correlation coefficients. These statistics provide a summary of the dataset's central tendencies, dispersion, and relationships between variables.

#Visualization: Create various visualizations to gain insights into the data. Common plots include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. Visualization helps identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data.

#Distribution Analysis: Examine the distribution of individual variables through histograms or density plots. This analysis provides an understanding of the data's shape, skewness, and presence of outliers.

#Relationships between Variables: Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, or heatmaps. This helps identify associations, dependencies, or potential multicollinearity among variables.

#Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly impact analysis results, so it's important to determine if they are valid data points or errors in measurement.

#Feature Engineering: Create new variables or transform existing ones to extract more meaningful insights. This could involve creating ratios, aggregating data, or deriving new features from existing ones.

#Hypothesis Testing: Formulate initial hypotheses based on the observations made during EDA. Conduct statistical tests or perform A/B testing to validate or reject these hypotheses.

#Documentation: Document the findings, insights, and decisions made during the EDA process. This helps communicate the results to stakeholders and serves as a reference for future analysis.

Remember, EDA is an iterative process. As you uncover insights and gain a deeper understanding of the data, you may need to revisit previous steps and refine your analysis.
